# Learning Systems 

Intro to ML theory with a practical part in the third term. 

Things to note:
- know bayes rule, matrix applications
- not programming heavy - more on theory
- attend 3-4pm for discussion of the lecture on the day (at least 8/18)
- cant use process of elimination for answering the MC questions (must derive the ans and show proof)
- not a programming course so we dont have to care about explaning everything
- special lects: 10,16,12,18 

Things to setup:
- https://github.com/nielsborie/machine-learning-environments 
- checking `jupyter nbconvert /path/to/mynotebook.ipynb --to latex`
-
